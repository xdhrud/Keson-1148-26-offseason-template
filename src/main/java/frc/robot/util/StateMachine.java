/**
 * Example of a Finite State Machine (FSM) using simple methods to build the FSM. The syntax is
 * essentially similar to typical FSM documentation.
 * 
 * <p>Based on the user-facing appearance of Command-Based V3 (as of 10/2025).
 * 
 * <p>This is similar to typical coding of Triggers with conditions and onTrue commands. A benefit
 * of this FSM implementation is the state-changing triggers exist only for the duration of the state
 * instead of being a perpetual part of the huge mass of triggers for the robot code.
 * 
 * <p>Another feature is an automatically created internal trigger for when a state command completes
 * normally instead of being interrupted. Use "whenComplete()" to use that feature. Use "when()" for a
 * typical external trigger condition.
 * 
 * <p>Multiple transitions with the same effective conditions are effectively undefined actions. Both
 * transitions may be triggered in quick succession. There is validation to prevent using a condition
 * object more than once but there is no way to prevent using the effectively identical condition in
 * more than one object. WARNING - Do not specify two different transitions with effectively the same
 * condition. There is no way to prevent programmatically a different condition object that triggers
 * on the same logic. The user must get this right. A warning message is attempted to be provided if
 * there are multiple transitions triggered simultaneously by different but functionally identical
 * conditions. (Providing a replacement event polling mechanism could prevent this occurrence but this
 * code is trying to use standard WPILib Command-Based V2 functions.)
 * 
 * <p>Duplicate conditions in the V3 2027 WPILib implementation may behave better but with the first
 * one being the one that is used (V3 is structured very differently - better than V2).
 * 
 * <p>Any state without a transition is an exit state if entered and completes; or hangs the
 * stateMachine if it doesn't complete. A purposeful exit can be coded with
 * "somestate.exitStateMachine().when(somecondition);" or "somestate.exitStateMachine().whenComplete();"
 * 
 * <p>The StateMachine does not have an idle state. Any state entered and does nothing until interrupted
 * would be idle for its duration. Example idle state shown below could be used to keep the StateMachine
 * running so it does not end and would not need to be recreated, say from a factory, for a restart.
 * 
 * <p>Command-Based classes are used to wrap the users commands and triggers in order to define the
 * FSM "cyclic" or "branching" behavior. The general flow is: the user builds the StateMachine with
 * states and transition conditions that trigger the next state. StateMachine command initialize
 * schedules the initial (start) state. The StateMachineCommand execute polls the event loop looking
 * to start the next the command for the next state. The next state (of the initial state) initialize
 * cleans up the previous state and builds its event triggers. A special variable indicates if a state
 * has completed normally. A special variable indicates if the StateMachine is the exit (end).
 * 
 * <p>This code has incomplete validation to prevent all really bad parameters. There is some validation
 * of inappropriate use of nulls, duplicate usage of condition objects, and duplicate conditions in
 * different objects for a single state. The anticipated V3 implementation has much better validation
 * against things you shouldn't do.
 * 
 * <p>Some of the transition builder code was copied from an early version of the V3 StateMachine and
 * may have some statements that aren't pertinent to this V2 implementation. Some of it has been
 * changed already for V3 but wasn't changed herein for V2.
